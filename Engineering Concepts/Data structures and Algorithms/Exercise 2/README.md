## Scenario: 
You are working on the search functionality of an e-commerce platform. The search needs to be optimized for fast performance.

--- 


## Steps:
  ### 1. Understand Asymptotic Notation:
  - Explain __Big O notation__ and how it helps in analyzing algorithms.
  -  Describe the best, average, and worst-case scenarios for search operations.
  ### 2. Setup:
  - Create a class `Product` with attributes for searching, such as  `productId`, `productName`, and `category`.
  ### 3. Implementation:
  - Implement `linear search` and `binary search` algorithms.
  - Store products in an array for linear search and a sorted array for binary search.
  ### 4. Analysis:
  - Compare the __time complexity__ of linear and binary search algorithms.
  - Discuss which algorithm is more suitable for your platform and why.
