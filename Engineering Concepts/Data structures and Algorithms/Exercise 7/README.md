# FINANCIAL FORECASTING

## Scenario: 
You are developing a financial forecasting tool that predicts future values based on past data.
---
## Steps:
### 1. Understand __Recursive Algorithms__:
-	Explain the concept of __recursion__ and how it can simplify certain problems.
### 2. Setup:
-	Create a method to calculate the future value using a recursive approach.
### 3. Implementation:
-	Implement a recursive algorithm to predict future values based on past growth rates.
### 4. Analysis:
-	Discuss the __time complexity__ of your recursive algorithm.
-	Explain how to optimize the recursive solution to avoid excessive computation
